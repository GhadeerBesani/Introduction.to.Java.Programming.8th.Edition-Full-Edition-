/*
(Physics: finding runway length) Given an airplaneâ€™s acceleration a and take-off
speed v, you can compute the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to
take off using the following formula:
length = (v^2)/(2*a)
Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and the
acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2) and displays the minimum runway
length.
